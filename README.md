# Install Magento 2 Customer Import module
    composer require aberrantcode/customer-import
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy

IMPORTANT : Keep CSV and JSON file inside pub/media folders for customer importing
So to import from the CSV and the JSON respectively the user would execute
either one of the following 

```
bin/magento customer:import sample-csv sample.csv
bin/magento customer:import sample-json sample.json
```
NOTE:I encountered some challenges with my laptopÂ  as it is not compatible for Magento2 development , 
so I had to complete all tasks on a cloud server. Unfortunately, this meant that I was unable to perform the 
phpcodesniffer test and some unit tests due to issues such as "Config file allure/allure.config.php doesn't exist."
    Magento Version :  "2.4.6-p3"
	Php Version: 8.1.26
